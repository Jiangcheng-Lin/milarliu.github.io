> In this academic project, we conducted conjoint analysis for a relatively small toy company, EarlyRiders, that specializes in the manufacture of quality toy riding horses with a particular focus on natural materials. EarlyRiders had a recent management change and realized that their product set was underperforming. They currently offer two products and one in particular was not doing well. The management team decided after much deliberation to revitalize their product portfolio based on the opinions of potential end-users. For this purpose, we ran a conjoint analysis, analyzed the data and created a presentation to recommend on new product (set) launch.

> In the conjoint analysis to optimize product launch decision, we executed benefit segmentation (including a-priori and post-hoc) and market simulation. We identified configuration of potential product profiles that gains the most market share, and eventually achieved potential profit uplift amounting to $40,000.

### Pricing Strategy for Iron Mountain (Information Management Services Company) - Business Intelligence with R, Python and Pricefx

**[View Project Report on Github](https://github.com/milarliu/milarliu.github.io/blob/master/Pricing%20Strategy%20for%20Iron%20Mountain.pdf)**

> I worked with four amazing teammates - Andy (Jiangcheng) Lin, Echo (Yuqiao) Zhong, Kaili Tan, and Yuheng Xiong. We were honored to win the first place in this case competition.

> In this case competition project, we analyzed sales data of Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE: IRM), a global leader for storage and information management services trusted by more than 225,000 organization around the world. A segment of IRM that accounts for approximately $80 million of revenue per year recently acquired several entities. Following the acquisitions, IRM is merging the data into one system in 2020. IRM would like to optimize the Revenue Management Strategy this year. For this purpose, we ran a pricing analysis and gave recommendation to support client's decision making on whether to consolidate the price offerings or continue to offer different pricing by location.

> We analyzed the data on price elasticity and product line; designed customer segmentation focusing on the recent acquisition. Utilizing R, Python and Pricefx (sponsor of the case competition), we visualized the insights. We also developed a profitable pricing strategy for Iron Mountain, and estimated the potential impact of our recommendations.

### Credit Risk Prediction Analysis and Interactive Interface for Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) applications - Machine Learning with Python

**[View Project Report on Github](https://github.com/milarliu/milarliu.github.io/blob/master/Credit%20Risk%20Analysis%20for%20HELOC.pdf)**

**[View ipynb Notebook Appendix on Github](https://github.com/milarliu/milarliu.github.io/blob/master/Credit%20Risk%20Analysis%20for%20HELOC_Code.ipynb)**

> In this academic project, we developed a predictive model and a decision support system (DSS) that evaluates the risk of HELOC applications. Data provided by FICO Community: https://community.fico.com/s/explainable-machine-learning-challenge. 

> We trained machine learning models (including Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Single Decision Tree, Bagging, Boosting, and Random Forest) to evaluate risk of credit card application. To make it user-friendly for sales representatives in a bank or credit card company to decide on accepting or rejecting applications, we designed interactive interface prototype that can be used to optimize decision-making in applicants screening process.
