> In this academic project, we conducted conjoint analysis for a relatively small toy company, EarlyRiders, that specializes in the manufacture of quality toy riding horses with a particular focus on natural materials. EarlyRiders had a recent management change and realized that their product set was underperforming. They currently offer two products and one in particular was not doing well. The management team decided after much deliberation to revitalize their product portfolio based on the opinions of potential end-users. For this purpose, we ran a conjoint analysis, analyzed the data and created a presentation to recommend on new product (set) launch.

> In the conjoint analysis to optimize product launch decision, we executed benefit segmentation (including a-priori and post-hoc) and market simulation. We identified configuration of potential product profiles that gains the most market share, and eventually achieved potential profit uplift amounting to $40,000.
